# Portfolio — Parithi Ezhilmathi (Upgraded)

This upgrade adds:
- Slide + bounce animations for sections
- A floating dark/light theme toggle (bottom-right)
- A working contact form using Formsubmit.co (sends to parithiezhilmathia@gmail.com)

Important: Contact form (Formsubmit)
- The form action is: https://formsubmit.co/parithiezhilmathia@gmail.com
- For the first submission, Formsubmit will send a confirmation email to parithiezhilmathia@gmail.com. You must click the confirmation link once to enable the form.
- If you want to customize the confirmation/redirect, visit https://formsubmit.co
